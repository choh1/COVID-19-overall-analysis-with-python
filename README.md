# COVID-19-overall-analysis-with-python

Project Description:

The project is on the current COVID-19 pandemic issues. It imports
COVID-19 datasets to perform an analysis of confirmed test cases, number of
deaths, and number of recovered patients in the US. The datasets were retrieved
from CDC and Our World in Data in the CSV format. The goal was to find meaningful
associations between the variables in the dataset. In this project analysis, I primarily
focused on a visualization method.

The main reason for selecting this project was that I wanted to challenge
myself and analyze a current pandemic issue with the skills that I gained from this
class. From this project, I was able to explore the dataset and perform visual
analysis on the dataset.

To run this project, first download the libraries, and import the datasets. First
part is the exploration of the dataset, then data processing. Second part is the
visualization which includes appropriate libraries for each plot with the correct labels.

This data provided a value for populations that were tested for positive and negative,
number of deaths and recovered patients, and whether the patient population is
hospitalized or not. It also contained information for increases in deaths and test
results.
